## Start Coding on NeoMutt (with help)

- Are you a keen NeoMutt user?
- Would you like to help the NeoMutt Project?
- Can you write code in C?
- Do you know the basics of [git version control](https://git-scm.com/)?

We've documented some "easy" coding tasks and we're looking for volunteers.

The tasks are:

- **Simple** - You don't need to be a C master to do them
- **Understandable** - You don't need to know the insides of NeoMutt
- **Low priority** - If it takes you a while, it doesn't matter
- **Mentored** - A NeoMutt project member will be assigned to help you

Get involved. YOU can make a difference!

Thanks â™¥ The NeoMutt Team

## How Do I Get Started?

First you'll need an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
This is [NeoMutt's home](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt) and where all the
development happens.

Now might be a good time to build NeoMutt for yourself.

The [download pages](/distro.html) for your OS should be helpful to install the
dependencies you'll need to build NeoMutt.  Then, [Building NeoMutt](/dev/build)
will show you the steps to download, configure and build the source.  Later you
might need the [Debugging NeoMutt](build/debug) page to help you debug and test
your changes.

Now, let's find a challenge...
Click on [![good first issue](/images/labels/good-first-issue.svg)](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues?q=label:"good first issue")
Some are very simple, but they all need doing and we'd love some help.

When you've found an task that you like, add a comment to show your interest.
Then start asking questions.  ([Contacting the developers](/about))

## What Happens Next?

- Ask questions
- Write code
- Create a Pull Request
- Have your code reviewed by the NeoMutt admins
- Have your code accepted and merged
- See your code released (and get your name in the release notes)
- Get an Invite to join the NeoMutt Team

We'll talk you through the steps as you get to them.

## What Else do I Need to Know?

- [Newbie Tutorial](/dev/newbie-tutorial) - Useful stuff to know
- [Coding Style](/dev/code) - Keeping the code tidy
- [Code of Conduct](/conduct) - Santa's Watching :-)
- [Roadmap](/dev/roadmap) - What are the other developers planning / doing?

## Medium Tasks

The "medium" tasks are hopefully a small step up from the "easy" tasks.

These tasks:
- Are **more complex** than the "easy" tasks
- May require some **investigation** beforehand
- May involve **changing lots of code** and dependencies

For example:
- Refactoring a large piece of code
- Adding a small new feature

**Help will be available**, but we'll expect you to be more self-sufficient.
