Gathered and implemented patches

## Notes

NeoMutt has brought together lots of Mutt patches, many of which were useful,
but had been abandoned.

Before each patch is marked stable:

- The code is brought up-to-date with Mutt-1.8.0
- The code is tidied up, comments added, checks done
- Documentation is written
- A sample muttrc is created
- The feature is tested

To find out more, see the [Development Page](/dev.html).
