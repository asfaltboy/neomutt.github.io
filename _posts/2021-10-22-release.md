## :book: Notes

This is a Bug-Fix Release.

Most notably, it fixes the problems with new mail.
You should now get notifications again and change-folder will prompt you with
folders containing new mail.

We have removed the Slang GUI from the build.
It doesn't work; it isn't understood; it's seldom used.
