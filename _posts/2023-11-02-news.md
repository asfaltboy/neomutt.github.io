title: Fedora COPR Deprecation
---

For the 7 years NeoMutt's been around, I've been creating RPMs on Fedora's COPR.

- https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/flatcap/neomutt/

I will make one final release, tomorrow.  
In a few months, I will permanently remove the repo.  
You can update your config, by running.

```sh
dnf copr remove flatcap/neomutt
```

---

For over 6 months, I've been able to release RPMs to Fedora directly.  
To install NeoMutt, simply:

```sh
dnf install neomutt
```

Cheers,
