## :gift: Moving Home

NeoMutt has moved its IRC channel to [**libera.chat**](https://libera.chat/)

If you don't have an IRC client, you can use Kiwi's web client:

- [#neomutt](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.libera.chat/#neomutt)

## :cloud_with_rain: FreeNode

For many years, we've been using FreeNode's IRC server to offer support and a
social space for the NeoMutt project.

Unfortunately, recently things at FreeNode turned sour.
All the volunteer staff resigned in protest.

## :sun_with_face: Libera

Fortunately, they started a new IRC network: [**libera.chat**](https://libera.chat/)

Many high-profile projects immediately moved their communities to Libera.

We invite you to join us in `#neomutt` on `irc.libera.chat`
