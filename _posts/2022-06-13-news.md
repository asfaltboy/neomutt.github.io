Hi, I'm Rich Russon (@flatcap), and I :heart: Open Source.

I'm the creator (and [BDFL](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=BDFL)) of [✉️ NeoMutt](https://neomutt.org/) -- a fast, flexible text email client.

I also dabble in [vim plugins](https://github.com/flatcap?tab=repositories&q=vim&type=source).  I'm particularly proud of:
- [vim-piper](https://github.com/flatcap/vim-piper.git) - Create configurable mappings for piping blocks of text
- [vim-mnemosyne](https://github.com/flatcap/vim-mnemosyne.git) - Keep a large buffer of Vim macros
- [vim-deleteto](https://github.com/flatcap/vim-deleteto.git) - Delete from the beginning of line up to a certain character

Linux Kernel contributions:
- [NTFS: Windows' filesystem driver](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/ntfs)
  Major contributor.  Coding, reverse-engineering the filesystem and [documenting the results](https://github.com/flatcap?tab=repositories&q=ntfs)
- [LDM - Logical Disk manager](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/block/partitions/ldm.c) (Windows' partition system)
  Creator.  Reverse-engineering the partition format and [documenting the results](https://github.com/flatcap?tab=repositories&q=ldm)
