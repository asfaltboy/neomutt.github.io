title: Analysis of NeoMutt
---

A few weeks back Federico (@fekir) created a huge number of code
improvements based on 'cppcheck' (a static analyser).  He documented how
he did it on a new developer page:

- [https://neomutt.org/dev/analysis](https://neomutt.org/dev/analysis)

I've just filled out all the other ways and tools which we've used to
improve the code and debug NeoMutt.
