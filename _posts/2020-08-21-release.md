## :book: Notes

This is a Bug-Fix Release.

See [last week's Release Notes](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/releases/tag/20200814) for other recent changes.

- Sidebar users are urged to use `%D` in their `$sidebar_format` if they use `named-mailboxes`
  This will show the **D**escriptive name, rather than the mailbox path or Notmuch query.
  e.g. `set sidebar_format = "%D%*  %n"`
