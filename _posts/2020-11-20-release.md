## :book: Notes

In addition to the usual share of bug fixes and enhancements, this release
fixes a security vulnerability whereas an early error in communicating with
an IMAP server was not properly detected as fatal, resulting in a potential
for sensitive information (user, pass) being sent over an untrusted channel.

Thanks to Gabriel Salles-Loustau for spotting the problem.
