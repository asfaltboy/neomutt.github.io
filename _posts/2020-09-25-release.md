## :book: Notes

It's been a busy month for NeoMutt with five new contributors.
They've been fixing things and adding new features.

If you'd like to help, come say "Hello!" in our IRC channel, or email me.
There are plenty of simple jobs to get started on, and **mentoring** is available.

- `#neomutt` on `irc.freenode.net` (or https://webchat.freenode.net/?channel=#neomutt)
- Richard Russon (@flatcap) <<rich@flatcap.org>>

This release sees some more modernisations.

- Compose: can now display user-defined headers (see `my_hdr`).
- Address Book / Query: can now be searched using patterns:
  - `~f` Alias (**f**rom)
  - `~t` Address (**t**o)
  - `~c` Comment

- Config: String Lists now support `+=` and `-=` to add/remove items.
  Strings now support `+=` for concatenation.
