## :book: Notes

This is a Bug-Fix Release.

After last week's enormous release, it's a great relief that few bugs have been found.

The biggest change in this release is the colour handling.
I'd hoped the last release would be a stepping stone to improved colour handling.
Lots of you explained, in detail, how that wasn't the case.

Sorry!

All colours should now work correctly.
In particular, "default" means transparent.

```
# Emails with subject "work" are blue
color index blue    default "~s work"

# Emails from "boss" have background red
color index default red     "~f boss"
```

Emails that match both conditions will be blue with a red background.
Before this release, only the last matching `color` line would be applied.
